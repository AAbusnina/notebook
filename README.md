SheffieldML Notebook Repository
========

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that can be used for demonstrating our software.

We have split the notebooks into groups.

[Computational Biology Notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/compbio/index.ipynb) Give some examples of work completed in different projects and implemented in GPy. 

[Lab Classes}(http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/index.ipynb) Gives a summary of notebooks that have been used in lab classes for teaching using our software.

See also the [notebooks associated with our open data science software repository](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sods/ods/blob/master/notebooks/pods/index.ipynb).
